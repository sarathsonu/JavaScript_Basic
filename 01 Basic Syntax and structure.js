JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

Automatically
Using var
Using let
Using const
*/

// Data Type (String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Object, Array)

/*
JavaScript data types can be categorized as primitive and non-primitive
primitive data types âˆ’

Strings of text e.g. "This text string" etc.
Numbers, eg. 123, 120.50 etc.
Boolean e.g. true or false.
null
undefined
BigInt
Symbol
Object
Array

object and array are non-primitive
BigInt and Symbol are introduced in ES6. In ES5, there were only five primitive data types.

BigInt
JavaScript stores only 64-bit long floating point numbers. If you want to store a very large number, you should use the Bigint. 
You can create Bigint by appending n to the end of the number.

Symbol
It is used to create unique primitive, and immutable values.
The Symbol() constructor can be used to create a unique symbol, and you may pass the string as a parameter of the Symbol() constructor.
